To set up this project, you'll need a Blockfrost API key for the Preview network.  
You can get one using their free tier â€” visit the https://blockfrost.io/ website and follow their instructions.  
Next, add a file to the project folder named config.py. Inside that file, add the api key like so: `blockfrost_api_key="YOUR API KEY"`.
